description: "Clients are organizations that are managed under a Channel Partner in Launchpad. A client is the secure space where you add buildings, invite users, and control how those users sign in and what they can do. Use this page to understand how client workspaces are structured and to complete the first setup tasks. "

### **How Clients Fit in Launchpad**

Each **Client** is a customer of the **Channel Partner**, an organisation or tenant with its own workspace.

Inside each **Client**, you manage:

- **Buildings**: Physical sites they monitor, like offices, campuses, and facilities.
- **Users**: People who access those buildings.
- **Roles and Permissions**: Define what each user is authorised to do.
- **Authentication & Security (SSO)**: How users sign in securely.
- **Trusted Organisations**: Share data or access with other clients.
- **Service Accounts**: Automate integrations or API connections.

/>

### **Create or open a client when:**

- A Channel Partner is onboarding a new customer.
- You need to group buildings and users for one customer.
- You must apply different access or security settings for one organization.

## **Add your first building in Launchpad**

You need at least one building to begin using your client workspace. A building represents a physical facility that you monitor and control through KODE OS. Adding a building lets you link systems, invite users, and track data for that site. It’s the first step toward managing your portfolio.

### Prerequisites

Before adding a building, make sure you:

- Have access to a **Client** under a **Channel Partner**.
- Hold the **Admin** or **Manager** role for that client.
- Know your building’s name and location.

## Control Access with Roles and Permissions

Use roles and permissions in Launchpad to control who can access and manage KODE OS modules and data. Administrators can view existing roles, add new ones, and assign the right permissions for each user.

### Why roles matter

Roles keep the workspace secure and organized. They determine who can manage buildings, dashboards, or automations, and who can simply view them.\
Launchpad uses **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to manage user access.\
Instead of assigning individual permissions to each user, permissions are grouped under _roles_, and users inherit access based on their assigned role.

**Prerequisites**

- You must have an **Admin** or **Super Admin** role.
- At least one **user** and **building** must exist.
- If your organization uses **SSO**, ensure IdP role attributes are configured.

<Accordion title="View existing roles">
  1. In **Launchpad**, click **Apps \>\> KODE OS**.
  2. Select the **Roles**. The **Roles list** appears, showing each role, description, and permission count.
  3. Click a role to view its details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Add a new role">
  1. In the **Roles list**, click **\+ Add Role**.
  2. Enter a Role**Name**  and **Description**.
  3. Under **Permissions**, select modules and submodules to include.
  4. Choose **Read** or **Write** access for each.
  5. Click **Save**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Edit a role">
  1. In the **Roles list**, select the role to modify.
  2. Click **Edit**.
  3. Update role details or adjust permission checkboxes.
  4. Click **Save**.

  <Info>
    ⚠️ A warning icon may appear beside dependent modules; hover to view the relationships.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Copy from an existing role">
  1. In the **Roles list**, click **\+ Add Role**.
     1. Click **Copy From Another Role**.
     2. Choose a source role and click **Save**.
     3. Edit any fields or permissions as needed.
     4. Click **Save** again.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Delete a role " description="You cannot delete a role if users are still assigned to it.">
  1. In the **Roles list**, select the role to remove.
     1. Click **Delete**.
     2. Click **Yes, Delete**.
</Accordion>

### Understanding role mapping (for SSO Integration)

When **Single Sign-On (SSO)** is enabled, your organization’s **Identity Provider (IdP)** can directly map its internal roles to KODE OS roles.\
That means:

- Authentication happens in the IdP.
- Role-based permissions automatically pass to KODE OS when a user logs in.

This approach keeps access control consistent across systems and allows IT admins to manage roles from a single source.

<Accordion title="Map user roles">
  1. In **Launchpad**, click **Sign-in Methods**.
  2. Select the authentication method to configure.
  3. Open the **Role Mapping** tab.
  4. Click **\+ Assign Role(s)**.
  5. Enter the following details.

        a. **Role Name / IdP Role Identifier**. The  name or UID of the IdP group.

         b.**Launchpad Role**  (required)

         c. **myMSI** and **KODE OS** roles (optional)
  6. Click **Assign Role(s)**.
</Accordion>

### How permissions are structured

**Permissions** define what a user can do within a module or submodule of KODE OS.\
Each permission is tied to a role which grants users their effective access.

**Types of permissions**

- **Read Permissions**: Enables users to view information or access specific features within a module or submodule.
- **Write Permissions**: Grants users the ability to modify, create, or delete data and configurations within a module or submodule.

Permissions are grouped into **modules**, like Buildings, Maintenance, Users and **submodules**, like Users \> General.\
This structure allows administrators to give granular, precise access.

**Prerequisites**

- Have **Admin** or **Super Admin** permissions in Launchpad.
- Have already created a **role** in Launchpad.
- Know what level of access that role should have for user management.

<Accordion title="Assign permissions to a role">
  1. In **Launchpad**, go to **Apps → KODE OS → Roles**.
  2. Select the role to modify.
  3. Click **Edit**.
  4. In **Permissions**, expand a module (for example, _Maintenance_ or _Buildings_).
  5. Select **Read** or **Write** checkboxes as needed.
  6. Click **Save**.

  <Note>
    Assign only the minimum permissions needed to keep your access model secure and auditable.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fine-tune permissions with constraints" description="Once you’ve assigned base permissions, you can limit how those permissions behave for specific user roles.">

   2. Click **KODE OS**.
   3. Open the **Roles**.
   4. Select the role  to modify, then click **Edit**.
   5. In  **Permissions**, go to **Users \>\> General**.
   6. Select  the read and write permissions you want to enable:
      - **Get Users** — view existing users.
      - **Create Users** — add new users.
      - **Delete Users** — remove users from KODE OS.

      After selecting the permissions, you can fine-tune them by applying constraints.
   7. Next to **Get Users**, click **Constraints**. 
   8.  Select **AssignedInSameBuilding**. This limits the role to managing users only within the buildings they’re assigned to.
   9.  Click **Confirm**.

## Set up Authentication and Single Sign-On

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** allows users to log in to KODE OS with their existing organization credentials instead of separate KODE Labs accounts.\
Launchpad supports industry-standard protocols, **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** and **Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)** — to connect with your identity management platform.

When SSO is enabled:

- Users authenticate through your organization’s **IdP** (e.g., Azure AD, Okta, CyberArk, Auth0, or JumpCloud).
- Access to KODE OS and related apps is automatically granted once verified.
- Administrators retain centralized control over user access and permissions.

**Before you begin**

To enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for your organization, ensure you have:

- **Admin role** in your KODE Labs workspace.
- Access to your **Identity Provider (IdP)** configuration settings.
- One of the following authentication protocols is available:
  - **SAML 2.0**
  - **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**

<Accordion title="Set up SSO in Launchpad">
  1. In **Launchpad**, open the sidebar and click **Sign-in Methods**.\
     The **Sign-in Methods** page displays all configured IAM methods.

## **Service Account Setup**

Service Account in Launchpad allows secure, automated communication between KODE OS and external systems or integrations.\
These accounts are designed for system-to-system authentication — not for individual users — and are commonly used for API access, automation, and integration with third-party platforms.

Each service account includes:

- A **credential type,** such as Private Key JWT or Client Secret.
- **Access scopes** and **permissions** for specific resources.
- **Keys** with configurable lifecycles and expiration alerts.

**Before you begin**

- **Admin or Super Admin** privileges in Launchpad.
- Access to **Client Management** in your workspace.
- (Optional) A list of sites where this service account will operate.

### Accessing the Service Account

To begin creating a Service Account, navigate to its management area in Launchpad, where administrators can view all existing service accounts, create new ones, and manage keys, permissions, and access scopes.

<Tip>
  Before creating a Service Account or generating keys, review how Launchpad manages its lifecycle.\
  This helps prevent accidental loss of credentials or access disruptions.

  **Key lifecycle**

  - Disable a key to revoke its access temporarily.
  - Re-enable a disabled key if needed.
  - Delete a disabled key to remove it permanently.

  **Service Account lifecycle**

  - Disable the account to suspend all associated keys.
  - Delete the account only after it’s disabled.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Once deleted, neither a Service Account nor its keys can be recovered.
</Warning>

1. Log in to **Launchpad**.
2. From the sidebar, go to **Client Management \>\> Service Accounts**.

<Accordion title="Create a New Service Account">
  1. Click **\+ Add Service**.
  2. Enter a **Name**  for the new account.
  3. Select a **Credential Type**:
     - **Private Key JWT** is recommended. It uses asymmetric cryptography for secure, automated authentication. It prevents transmitting shared secrets and is preferred for production-grade integrations.
     - **Client Secret**. It is a shared secret-based method for simpler integrations. 
  4. Enter **Description**.
  5. In **Sites**,  either:
     - **Select All Sites**, or
     - Specific**Sites**  from the drop-down.
  6. Click **Save**.
</Accordion>

After creating a service account, you’re redirected to the **Service Account Details** page. From here, you can create and manage keys.

  5. Click **Save**.
</Accordion>

### Service Account Permissions

You can customize the permissions for each Service Account to control access levels, define integration scopes, and maintain visibility into all system activities.\
By default, new service accounts have no permissions enabled.

**Permission Scopes and Access Levels**

Permissions are assigned through access levels, which determine what each account can read, write, or create within KODE OS.\
Common permission scopes include:

- **Read Buildings**. It is required for all other permissions to function.
- **Read Devices**, **Add Devices**
- **Read Building Areas**
- **Read / Add / Write Points**
- **Read / Create Timeseries**

Each permission can be enabled independently, allowing developers to fine-tune integrations with just the right level of access.

<Accordion title="Manage Permissions for a Service Account">
  1. Go to ****Service Accounts,  select a service account and clickPermissions**** .
  2. Click **Edit**.
  3. Select the \*\*Read \*\*or \*\*Write \*\*permissions for each group. For example, PointsPublic, TimeseriesPublic, and DevicesPublic.

     <Tip>
       Color indicators show which permissions are active in each section.

       🟢 **Green:** Read enabled\
       🟠 **Orange:** Write enabled
     </Tip>

  3. Click **Buildings.**
  4. Review the assigned sites.
  5. To add more sites:
     - Click **\+ Assign Buildings**.
     - Select additional sites.
     - Click **Save**.
</Accordion>

Service Accounts in Launchpad provide a secure, structured way to manage integrations and control access through keys and permissions. Proper setup and key rotation help ensure safe and efficient API operations.
