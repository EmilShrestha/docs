### **How Clients fit in Launchpad**

Each **Client** is a customer of the **Channel Partner**, an organisation or tenant with its own workspace.

Inside each **Client**, you manage:

- **Buildings**: Physical sites they monitor, like offices, campuses, and facilities.
- **Users**: People who access those buildings.
- **Roles and Permissions**: Define what each user can do.
- **Authentication & Security (SSO)**: How users sign in securely.
- **Trusted Organisations**: Share data or access with other clients.
- **Service Accounts**: Automate integrations or API connections.

### **Create or open a client when:**

- A Channel Partner is onboarding a new customer.
- You need to group buildings and users for one customer.
- You must apply different access or security settings for one organization.

## **Add your first building in Launchpad**

You need at least one building to begin using your client workspace. A building represents a physical facility that you monitor and control through KODE OS. Adding a building lets you link systems, invite users, and track data for that site. It’s the first step toward managing your portfolio.

### Prerequisites

Before adding a building, make sure you:

- Have access to a **Client** under a **Channel Partner**.
- Hold the **Admin** or **Manager** role for that client.
- Know your building’s name and location.
