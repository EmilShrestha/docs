### **How Clients Fit in Launchpad**

Each **Client** is a customer of the **Channel Partner**, an organisation or tenant with its own workspace.

Inside each **Client**, you manage:

- **Buildings**: Physical sites they monitor, like offices, campuses, and facilities.
- **Users**: People who access those buildings.
- **Roles and Permissions**: Define what each user is authorised to do.
- **Authentication & Security (SSO)**: How users sign in securely.
- **Trusted Organisations**: Share data or access with other clients.
- **Service Accounts**: Automate integrations or API connections.

/>

### **Create or open a client when:**

- A Channel Partner is onboarding a new customer.
- You need to group buildings and users for one customer.
- You must apply different access or security settings for one organization.

## **Add your first building in Launchpad**

You need at least one building to begin using your client workspace. A building represents a physical facility that you monitor and control through KODE OS. Adding a building lets you link systems, invite users, and track data for that site. It’s the first step toward managing your portfolio.

### Prerequisites

Before adding a building, make sure you:

- Have access to a **Client** under a **Channel Partner**.
- Hold the **Admin** or **Manager** role for that client.
- Know your building’s name and location.

## Control Access with Roles and Permissions

Use roles and permissions in Launchpad to control who can access and manage KODE OS modules and data. Administrators can view existing roles, add new ones, and assign the right permissions for each user.

### Why roles matter

Roles keep the workspace secure and organized. They determine who can manage buildings, dashboards, or automations, and who can simply view them.\
Launchpad uses **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to manage user access.\
Instead of assigning individual permissions to each user, permissions are grouped under _roles_, and users inherit access based on their assigned role.

**Prerequisites**

- You must have an **Admin** or **Super Admin** role.
- At least one **user** and **building** must exist.
- If your organization uses **SSO**, ensure IdP role attributes are configured.

<Accordion title="View existing roles">
  1. In **Launchpad**, click **Apps \>\> KODE OS**.
  2. Select the **Roles**. The **Roles list** appears, showing each role, description, and permission count.
  3. Click a role to view its details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Add a new role">
  1. In the **Roles list**, click **\+ Add Role**.
  2. Enter a Role**Name**  and **Description**.
  3. Under **Permissions**, select modules and submodules to include.
  4. Choose **Read** or **Write** access for each.
  5. Click **Save**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Edit a role">
  1. In the **Roles list**, select the role to modify.
  2. Click **Edit**.
  3. Update role details or adjust permission checkboxes.
  4. Click **Save**.

  <Info>
    ⚠️ A warning icon may appear beside dependent modules; hover to view the relationships.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Copy from an existing role">
  1. In the **Roles list**, click **\+ Add Role**.
     1. Click **Copy From Another Role**.
     2. Choose a source role and click **Save**.
     3. Edit any fields or permissions as needed.
     4. Click **Save** again.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Delete a role " description="You cannot delete a role if users are still assigned to it.">
  1. In the **Roles list**, select the role to remove.
     1. Click **Delete**.
     2. Click **Yes, Delete**.
</Accordion>

### Understanding role mapping (for SSO Integration)

When **Single Sign-On (SSO)** is enabled, your organization’s **Identity Provider (IdP)** can directly map its internal roles to KODE OS roles.\
That means:

- Authentication happens in the IdP.
- Role-based permissions automatically pass to KODE OS when a user logs in.

This approach keeps access control consistent across systems and allows IT admins to manage roles from a single source.

<Accordion title="Map user roles">
  1. In **Launchpad**, click **Sign-in Methods**.
  2. Select the authentication method to configure.
  3. Open the **Role Mapping** tab.
  4. Click **\+ Assign Role(s)**.
  5. Enter the following details.

        a. **Role Name / IdP Role Identifier**. The  name or UID of the IdP group.

         b.**Launchpad Role**  (required)

         c. **myMSI** and **KODE OS** roles (optional)
  6. Click **Assign Role(s)**.
</Accordion>

### How permissions are structured

**Permissions** define what a user can do within a module or submodule of KODE OS.\
Each permission is tied to a role which grants users their effective access.

**Types of permissions**

- **Read Permissions**: Enables users to view information or access specific features within a module or submodule.
- **Write Permissions**: Grants users the ability to modify, create, or delete data and configurations within a module or submodule.

Permissions are grouped into **modules**, like Buildings, Maintenance, Users and **submodules**, like Users \> General.\
This structure allows administrators to give granular, precise access.

**Prerequisites**

- Have **Admin** or **Super Admin** permissions in Launchpad.
- Have already created a **role** in Launchpad.
- Know what level of access that role should have for user management.

<Accordion title="Assign permissions to a role">
  1. In **Launchpad**, go to **Apps → KODE OS → Roles**.
  2. Select the role to modify.
  3. Click **Edit**.
  4. In **Permissions**, expand a module (for example, _Maintenance_ or _Buildings_).
  5. Select **Read** or **Write** checkboxes as needed.
  6. Click **Save**.

  <Note>
    Assign only the minimum permissions needed to keep your access model secure and auditable.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fine-tune permissions with constraints" description="Once you’ve assigned base permissions, you can limit how those permissions behave for specific user roles.">
  1. In the same **Permissions** section, scroll to **Users \>\> General**.
  2. Next to **Get Users**, click **Constraints**.
     - In the pop-up, select **Assigned in Same Building** to restrict access to buildings the user manages.
  3. For **Create Users** and **Delete Users**, click **Manage Constraints**.
     - Under **Choose Roles**, select which user types this role can create or delete.
  4. Click **Confirm**, then **Save**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Configure Permissions for Users in KODE OS">
   1. In **Launchpad**, click **Apps**.
   2. Click **KODE OS**.
   3. Open the **Roles**.
   4. Select the role  to modify, then click **Edit**.
   5. In  **Permissions**, go to **Users \>\> General**.
   6. Select  the read and write permissions you want to enable:
      - **Get Users** — view existing users.
      - **Create Users** — add new users.
      - **Delete Users** — remove users from KODE OS.

      After selecting the permissions, you can fine-tune them by applying constraints.
   7. Next to **Get Users**, click **Constraints**. 
   8.  Select **AssignedInSameBuilding**. This limits the role to managing users only within the buildings they’re assigned to.
   9.  Click **Confirm**.
  10. Next to **Create Users**, click **Manage Constraints**.

  14. In the **AllowedRoles** dropdown, select which user types this role can delete.
  15. Click **Confirm**.
  16. Click **Save**. The changes to user management for the selected role are saved.
</Accordion>

### **Permissions**

KODE OS permissions are organized by modules to help administrators configure user roles effectively.\
The tables below list every permission available in KODE OS, along with what each allows a user to do.

<Info>
  - Site-level permissions only apply when a user is assigned to that building.
  - Portfolio-level permissions apply globally.
</Info>

For each module, you’ll find a description of what the permission enables and whether it grants view-only or edit access.

<Note>
  We update permissions as new modules are added to KODE OS.
</Note>

Permissions are grouped by:

- **Modules**: Functional areas such as BuildingBI or Launchpad.
- **Submodules**: Specific components under each module, such as Dashboards or Datasources.
- **Access Levels**: Define what actions can be performed within each submodule.

**Permissions Reference Table**

Below is the detailed permission structure grouped by module.\
Each section lists its **submodules**, their **permissions**, **access levels**, and **descriptions**.

**BuildingBI Module**

## Set up Authentication and Single Sign-On

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** allows users to log in to KODE OS with their existing organization credentials instead of separate KODE Labs accounts.\
Launchpad supports industry-standard protocols, **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** and **Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)** — to connect with your identity management platform.

When SSO is enabled:

- Users authenticate through your organization’s **IdP** (e.g., Azure AD, Okta, CyberArk, Auth0, or JumpCloud).
- Access to KODE OS and related apps is automatically granted once verified.
- Administrators retain centralized control over user access and permissions.

**Before you begin**

To enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for your organization, ensure you have:

- **Admin role** in your KODE Labs workspace.
- Access to your **Identity Provider (IdP)** configuration settings.
- One of the following authentication protocols is available:
  - **SAML 2.0**
  - **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**

<Accordion title="Set up SSO in Launchpad">
  1. In **Launchpad**, open the sidebar and click **Sign-in Methods**.\
     The **Sign-in Methods** page displays all configured IAM methods.
  2. Click **\+ Add Sign-in Method**.
  3. Select an existing template or choose a **custom method (OIDC or SAML)**.
  4. In **Sign-in Method Name**, enter a unique name for this connection.
  5. Review the auto-generated fields — **Assertion Consumer Service URL**, **SP Entity ID**, **Protocol Binding**, and **Signature Algorithm**.

     > 💡 Copy these values; you’ll need them in your IdP setup later.
  6. Enter any additional required information based on your IdP.
  7. Click **Save**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Configure the KODE Labs app in your IdP">
  1. Log in to your IdP account.
  2. Create a new application or connector.
  3. Provide the configuration details generated by Launchpad:
     - **Single Sign-on URL:** The Assertion Consumer Service URL from Launchpad.
     - **Entity ID:** The SP Entity ID or Audience URI.
     - **NameID Format:** _EmailAddress_.
     - **Signature Algorithm:** _RSA-SHA256_.
     - **Protocol Binding:** _HTTP-POST_.
  4. Under **Attribute Mapping**, add the following:
     - _First name_ attribute or claim.
     - _Last name_ attribute or claim.
     - Optional **roles** attribute to map IdP roles to KODE OS roles.
  5. Save your configuration.
  6. Copy your **IdP Single Sign-On URL** and **x509Certificate** (or download the metadata file).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Configure IdP details in Launchpad">
  1. Return to **Launchpad → Sign-in Methods**.
  2. Select your new SSO configuration.
  3. Upload your **Metadata file**, or manually enter:
     - **IdP URL**
     - **Certificate (x509)**
     - **Attribute Configuration**
  4. Click **Save**.
</Accordion>

SSO is now active. Users can log in through your organization’s IdP instead of separate KODE OS credentials.

<Accordion title="Configure role mapping">
  1. Before mapping, ensure role attributes exist in your IdP’s **Attribute Mappings**.
  2. In **Launchpad**, go to **Sign-in Methods → Role Mapping**.
  3. Click **\+ Assign Role(s)**.
  4. In the dialog, enter:
     - **IdP Role Identifier** — the name or UID of the IdP group.
     - **Launchpad Role** — required.
     - **myMSI / KODE OS Roles** — optional.
  5. Click **Assign Role(s)**.

  ### Notes

  - Once IdP role mapping is enabled, role management for those users occurs in your IdP, not in KODE Labs.
  - You can enable:
    - **Create user on first login** — automatically create users on first sign-in.
    - **Default Role** — assign a fallback role for unmapped users.
    - **Update user role on login** — synchronize IdP role changes.
    - **Site Mapping** — link access to specific sites after saving.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Edit SSO configuration">

## Authentication & Security

**Authentication & Security **lets administrators manage organization-wide sign-in and session policies.\
It is available under **Security Settings \>\> Authentication & Security** and includes three key tabs:\
**Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**, **Password**, and **Timeout Settings**.

These settings strengthen access control across KODE OS and Launchpad by enforcing secure authentication, password policies, and session limits.

### **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**

MFA adds a verification step beyond username and password.\
When a user signs in from a new device or application, they are prompted to verify their identity using a second factor, such as a unique code from an authenticator app or a text message.\
This reduces the risk of unauthorized account access.

**How MFA Works**

On first sign-in from a new device:

1. The user enters their username and password.
2. They are prompted to enter a second authentication factor. For example, a one-time code from their authenticator app or received via SMS.
3. Once verified, the device is recognized for subsequent logins based on the configured MFA frequency.

Enabling MFA adds an essential layer of protection against credential compromise.

**Customize MFA Settings**

You can configure MFA behavior from **Security Settings \>\> Authentication & Security \>\> MFA**.

/>

- **Enforcement:** Choose whether to enforce MFA for all users or allow individual users to enable it themselves.

  <Note>
    SSO-authenticated users are excluded from this enforcement.
  </Note>
- **Frequency:** Define how often MFA prompts appear, at every login.

</Accordion>

### Password Settings

Password policies define how users create and maintain secure credentials.\
Strong password requirements reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access and credential reuse.\
All configurations are available under **Security Settings \>\> Authentication & Security \>\> Password**.

  title="Screenshot 2025-11-09 at 15.03.59.png"
  style={{ width:"62%" }}
/>

**Password Complexity**

You can enforce predefined or custom password complexity rules.

- **Medium:** Minimum 8 characters; includes at least one digit, one uppercase letter, and one special character.
- **High:** Maximum 12-64 characters; includes at least one digit, one uppercase letter, one special character, and no consecutive characters.

**Customize Password Complexity:**\
You can define whether passwords must include:

- Uppercase letters (A through Z).
- Base 10 digits (0 through 9).
- Non-alphanumeric characters (special characters).
- Non-consecutive characters.

**Lockout Settings**

T-o temporarily restrict access to a user account after a specified number of unsuccessful sign in attempts:

- **Retries before lockout:** Set how many failed attempts trigger a lockout. For example, allow five unsuccessful sign in attempts before the account enters a locked state.
- **Lockout time:** Define how long accounts remain locked before users can retry. For example, set the lockout time to one hour to temporarily restrict access while allowing users to regain entry after the specified duration.

**Password Configurations**

- **Password history:** Keeps a record of previously used passwords to prevent reuse and reduce the risk of compromised accounts.
- **Password expiry time:** Defines when users must update their passwords after a set period.

<Accordion title="FAQs">
  **Can administrators create custom password policies?**\
  Yes. Administrators can define custom password rules, including minimum length, required character types, and non-consecutive character enforcement.

  **How does password expiration work?**\
  When a password reaches its configured expiration period, users are prompted to change it upon their next login.

  **Does the system check for leaked passwords?**\
  Yes. The system checks passwords against known breached databases and prevents users from using compromised passwords.
</Accordion>

### Timeout Settings

Timeout policies automatically sign out inactive users to protect sensitive data. \
Configure them under **Security Settings → Authentication & Security → Timeout**.

<Tip>
  The timeouts can be configured in **days** or **hours**, depending on organizational needs.
</Tip>

  style={{ width:"67%" }}
/>

- **Session Timeout:** Sets the total duration a signed-in session remains active. After this time elapses without any user activity, the user is logged out.
- **Idle Timeout:** Defines the period of inactivity before automatic sign-out during an active session.

<Accordion title="Session Timeout Settings FAQs">
  **How are timeouts configured?**\
  Session and idle timeouts can be set in days or hours. After the configured period of inactivity, users are automatically signed out.

  **What values are supported for timeouts?**\
  Timeout values must be positive, whole numbers. Non-integer or negative inputs are not accepted.
</Accordion>

## **Service Account Setup**

Service Account in Launchpad allows secure, automated communication between KODE OS and external systems or integrations.\
These accounts are designed for system-to-system authentication — not for individual users — and are commonly used for API access, automation, and integration with third-party platforms.

Each service account includes:

- A **credential type,** such as Private Key JWT or Client Secret.
- **Access scopes** and **permissions** for specific resources.
- **Keys** with configurable lifecycles and expiration alerts.

**Before you begin**

- **Admin or Super Admin** privileges in Launchpad.
- Access to **Client Management** in your workspace.
- (Optional) A list of sites where this service account will operate.

### Accessing the Service Account

To begin creating a Service Account, navigate to its management area in Launchpad, where administrators can view all existing service accounts, create new ones, and manage keys, permissions, and access scopes.

<Tip>
  Before creating a Service Account or generating keys, review how Launchpad manages its lifecycle.\
  This helps prevent accidental loss of credentials or access disruptions.

  **Key lifecycle**

  - Disable a key to revoke its access temporarily.
  - Re-enable a disabled key if needed.
  - Delete a disabled key to remove it permanently.

  **Service Account lifecycle**

  - Disable the account to suspend all associated keys.
  - Delete the account only after it’s disabled.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Once deleted, neither a Service Account nor its keys can be recovered.
</Warning>

1. Log in to **Launchpad**.
2. From the sidebar, go to **Client Management \>\> Service Accounts**.

<Accordion title="Create a New Service Account">

### Service Account Permissions

You can customize the permissions for each Service Account to control access levels, define integration scopes, and maintain visibility into all system activities.\
By default, new service accounts have no permissions enabled.

**Permission Scopes and Access Levels**

Permissions are assigned through access levels, which determine what each account can read, write, or create within KODE OS.\
Common permission scopes include:

- **Read Buildings**. It is required for all other permissions to function.
- **Read Devices**, **Add Devices**
- **Read Building Areas**
- **Read / Add / Write Points**
- **Read / Create Timeseries**

Each permission can be enabled independently, allowing developers to fine-tune integrations with just the right level of access.

<Accordion title="Manage Permissions for a Service Account">
  1. Go to ****Service Accounts,  select a service account and clickPermissions**** .
  2. Click **Edit**.
  3. Select the \*\*Read \*\*or \*\*Write \*\*permissions for each group. For example, PointsPublic, TimeseriesPublic, and DevicesPublic.
